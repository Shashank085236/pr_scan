- Didn't see to convert ticket type to DSS - DS suite. It is not listed
- Snyk is more intutive with less hops for review process and trust on build in intelligence to mark vuln resolved.
Fortify has process for auditor review.
- No wait time to see if fix resolves the problem.
- Auto Jira ticket creation with needed details (No DSS)
- Auto PR raise mostly for dependencies version upgrade (In DS only build.gradle and is less practical for projects like DS)
- Better and simple ways to illustrate problems and fixes as compared to Fortify
- History and dashboard?
- Reports?
- False positives or accuracy? ?
- Static analysis on PRs are failing at times for DS. Resolution provided on snyk site is to close and reopen PR for retest
- Snyk gels better with OWASP top 10 than FoD(seems includes code smells, bad practices etc.)
- Synk is better if we want top down approach fixing focused and priority items first
- Fortify reports much more vulnerability than Snyk but there are many false positives as well. Accuracy of Snyk appears better
- Synk scans to find vuln in PR fails many times and they recommened closing and raising PR again
